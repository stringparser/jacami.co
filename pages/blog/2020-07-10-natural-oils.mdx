# Natural oil

Coming from the supermarket without being able to find a plain yogurt makes you feel compromised. Strawberry-apricot, apple-pear on the shelf and there are always ways to sway taste in different directions but we keep trying. What's wrong with plain yogurt. I can't find it. My brain succubs to give me a reasonable and time consuming explanation.

White sugar that is bleached to be white points to the right direction. It seems tongues are atractted to more and something familiar that can get you in a fulfilled state. Bio avocado section and natural oil are again reminders of the reality. Avocados are not necessarily, nor is anything else, treated better than sugar and as does oil so it begs the question of "what are these things then? is bio avocado or oil true? how can I trust? where is the plain yogurt?".

I don't know anymore to be honest. I actually feel insulted we have to put bio in front of anything grown. Is that fair that I claim my opinion on this? Probably not. Is that at all realistic that I can get in so far of the conversation that I might make a difference? In short: neither. All I want is honesty but that is actually in detriment forever more. Damm it brain, I was just figuring out if they had plain yogurt and you come with this.

Should I want to change this behavior? Not really. Can't I live without it? Not really.

So I have to find out my own way of manufacturing honesty.
