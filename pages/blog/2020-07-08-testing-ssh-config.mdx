# Testing ssh config

While setting up again this site today I noticed I didn't setup yet a `.ssh/config` file and, of course, I already had forgotten how to write in the format.

So I created a file first at `~/.ssh/config` and added

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
# ~/.ssh/config
Host github
	UseKeychain yes
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	HostName github.com
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_rsa
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then created a new ssh key with that name with the [steps we all know](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) from the github docs.

And added it to the keychain

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/config/id
`}
</CodeBlock>

But it wasn't working so I had to figure out why. Looking into `ssh` command line options found I could use

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
ssh -T git@github.com
`}
</CodeBlock>

to test the connection this said "Permission denied (public key)". As expected I guess.

Then I thought if I could see the log of the command it could help. There is a `-v` for `verbose` so... let's try that

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
ssh -vT git@github.com
`}</CodeBlock>

which showed

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
OpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3
debug1: Reading configuration data ~/.ssh/config
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *
debug1: Connecting to github.com port 22.
`}</CodeBlock>

Hmm... so that's not working. The configuration is not being applied. Is it the `Host` at the top? Let's try changing it

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
Host github.com
	UseKeychain yes
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	HostName github.com
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_rsa
`}
</CodeBlock>

and now?

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`
ssh -vT git@github.com
OpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3
debug1: Reading configuration data ~/.ssh/config
debug1: ~/.ssh/config line 1: Applying options for github.com
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *
`}
</CodeBlock>

Niiice. So that was it now configuration is applied and the ssh key is correctly used for `git push`.
