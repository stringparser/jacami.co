Let's test a bit this library and see how it works. It's supposed to have a lot of nice features and offline storage using IndexedDB which is great. On top of that is using rxjs which I love.

Ok first let's get started. I need:

- a service for to handle the connection etc.
- a component to that will render items as add them.

All right done. Testing locally. I'm expecting to:

- be able to add documents
- documents should be render after added
- reloading the page should show the same items
